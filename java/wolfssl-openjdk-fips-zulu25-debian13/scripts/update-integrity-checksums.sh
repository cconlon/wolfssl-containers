# The image build runs this once. Derived images that intentionally change a
# protected file (for example adding a CA certificate to the WKS cacerts, or
# editing java.security or /etc/krb5.conf) run it again as root in their
# Dockerfile after the change, otherwise the startup integrity check fails:
#
#     USER root
#     RUN <modify cacerts> && /usr/local/bin/update-integrity-checksums.sh
#     USER 10001:10001
#
# The checksum file is root-owned and read-only, so the non-root image user
# cannot run this successfully.

# Keep the file list in sync with REQUIRED_FILES in integrity-check.sh.
